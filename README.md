# MonoBlocks Professional™

*Yeah, so uh... this is like, an ASCII art editor or whatever.*

## What the Hell is This?

Alright, so check it out. Some guy named Aaron was probably sitting in his cubicle, you know, with his TPS reports and whatnot, and he's like "Man, I really need to draw some ASCII art but all these editors suck worse than a Monday morning meeting." So boom - MonoBlocks Professional was born.

It's got all these tools and crap for making ASCII art. You know, like back in the '90s when we thought the internet was gonna be all text-based forever? Yeah, turns out we were wrong about that one. But hey, ASCII art is still cool, I guess. Heh heh, cool.

## Features That Don't Suck (Too Much)

### The Tools, Man
- **Pan Tool** - Move stuff around like you're trying to find the stapler that Milton keeps talking about
- **Brush Tool** - Draw characters one at a time, real tedious-like
- **Rectangle Tool** - Make boxes. Whoa, boxes! Technology!
- **Line Tool** - Draw lines with arrows and stuff. Pretty neat, I tell you what
- **Text Tool** - Type words inside boxes because... uh... that's what you do
- **Select Tool** - Click on stuff to select it. Revolutionary
- **Eraser** - Delete mistakes, which you'll make a lot of, trust me
- **Eyedropper** - Pick colors like you're at Home Depot but for nerds

### Other Stuff That's Actually Pretty Cool
- **Dark Mode** - For when you're coding at 3 AM eating Cheetos in your underwear
- **Layers** - Stack your art like pancakes at IHOP
- **Undo/Redo** - Because everyone screws up
- **Export to PNG** - Turn your text art into a real image file. We live in the future!
- **Share Links** - Send your masterpiece to people who probably don't care
- **Copy to Clipboard** - Paste it into Slack and annoy your coworkers

## System Requirements

You need like, a computer or whatever. And one of those web browser thingies:
- Chrome (the one that eats all your RAM)
- Firefox (the one nobody uses anymore)
- Safari (if you're one of *those* people)
- Edge (lol)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone [repository url]

# Install the dependencies or whatever
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev
```

If it doesn't work, try turning it off and on again. That usually works.

## How to Use This Thing

1. Open it in your browser (duh)
2. Click on tools
3. Draw stuff
4. Realize you have no artistic talent
5. Delete everything
6. Try again
7. Give up and go watch TV

## The Professional™ Experience

Look, we put "Professional" in the name because it sounds fancy, alright? Like when Initech changed their name to "Initech Professional Services" - same crap, fancier name.

This editor comes with a built-in trial popup that says you've been using it for 42 days. Why 42? Because it's the answer to life, the universe, and everything, dumbass. Also, it never expires because we're too lazy to implement actual licensing.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+Z** - Undo (or Cmd+Z if you're using a Mac like some kind of designer)
- **Ctrl+Y** - Redo (because you undid too much)
- **Delete** - Delete selected shape (obvious, right?)
- **Escape** - Get out of whatever you're doing

## Tips for Maximum Productivity

1. Tell your boss you're "working on documentation"
2. Minimize it when someone walks by
3. Pretend you're doing something important
4. Make ASCII art of your manager as a potato
5. Don't share #4 with anyone

## Development Commands (For Nerds)

```bash
npm run dev        # Start the dev server (where the magic happens)
npm run build      # Build for production (make it go fast)
npm run test:unit  # Run tests (they probably pass)
npm run lint       # Make the code pretty
npm run preview    # Preview the build (spoiler: it looks the same)
```

## Known Issues

- Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't
- The color picker has more colors than a bag of Skittles
- Dark mode makes you look like a hacker (you're not)
- The grid never goes away (deal with it)
- You can't draw circles (life isn't fair)

4. Submit a pull request
5. Wait forever for someone to review it

## Credits

Made by Aaron, who probably should have been doing actual work instead.

Special thanks to:
- Coffee (couldn't have done it without you)
- Stack Overflow (for copy-paste solutions)
- That one guy who answered my question at 2 AM
- My rubber duck (best debugger ever)

## Final Thoughts

Look, it's an ASCII art editor. It's not gonna cure cancer or solve world hunger. But if you need to draw a picture using text characters for some reason, this'll do it. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go find my red Swingline stapler.
